Half square triangles (HSTs) are a classic sewing technique at the foundation of a number of traditional quilt blocks. DIY Blogger Nancy Purvis explores what happens when you play with placement, scale, and color of HSTs to achieve bold designs. And she doesn't stop there! Quilting from Every Angle also includes techniques on Flying Geese blocks, Y-seams, paper-piecing, and more. Whether it's acute or obtuse, Nancy's covering all the angles with valuable tips and tricks to achieving precision points.

        "description": "Completely revised and updated, this best-selling introduction to programming in JavaScript focuses on writing real applications. JavaScript lies at the heart of almost every modern web application, from social apps like Twitter to browser-based game frameworks like Phaser and Babylon. Though simple for beginners to pick up and play with, JavaScript is a flexible, complex language that you can use to build full-scale applications. This much anticipated and thoroughly revised third edition of Eloquent JavaScript dives deep into the JavaScript language to show you how to write beautiful, effective code. It has been updated to reflect the current state of Java¬Script and web browsers and includes brand-new material on features like class notation, arrow functions, iterators, async functions, template strings, and block scope. A host of new exercises have also been added to test your skills and keep you on track. As with previous editions, Haverbeke continues to teach through extensive examples and immerses you in code from the start, while exercises and full-chapter projects give you hands-on experience with writing your own programs. You start by learning the basic structure of the JavaScript language as well as control structures, functions, and data structures to help you write basic programs. Then you'll learn about error handling and bug fixing, modularity, and asynchronous programming before moving on to web browsers and how JavaScript is used to program them. As you build projects such as an artificial life simulation, a simple programming language, and a paint program, you'll learn how to: - Understand the essential elements of programming, including syntax, control, and data - Organize and clarify your code with object-oriented and functional programming techniques - Script the browser and make basic web applications - Use the DOM effectively to interact with browsers - Harness Node.js to build servers and utilities Isn't it time you became fluent in the language of the Web? * All source code is available online in an inter¬active sandbox, where you can edit the code, run it, and see its output instantly.",

        "description": "\"Bravery is not the absence of fear, but the ability to move forward despite that fear.\" Sixteen-year-old Arianna is at a crisis with her identity. Frustrated, she searches for answers to her past, but instead she finds herself teleported to a whole other fantasy world, a world suffering under the tyrannical rule of the Shadow Lord, Keshieena. Unintentionally branded as the powerful Stone Bearer, the protector of peace, and also the Fated One prophesied to restore the lost heir to the throne, Arianna embarks on a dangerous journey against all manner of evil. At first homesick and hesitant, Arianna doubts herself and her newfound abilities, but she is not alone. Under the protection and tutelage of her elusive yet handsome male companion, Arianna tests the limits of her powers, uncovering potential she'd never dreamed of. Together, they pursue a series of archived texts that lead them closer to finding the rightful heir to Fantacy's throne. However, with the Stone of Power in her possession, Arianna becomes the Shadow Lord's personal target. The stakes rise further as Arianna develops an attachment to the suffering peoples of Fantacy. Although Arianna might not have found the answers to her past, her future has become clear: find the heir, protect the Stone and bring back peace. Friendship, love, action and adventure... Part One in the Fantacy Duology, Fantacy: Daughter of Fate, is geared towards young adults and teenagers who have a nostalgic fondness for the brightness of Narnia fused with the romance and intrigue of more contemporary works such as Throne of Glass and Eragon.",
